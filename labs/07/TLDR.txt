Test the chatbot by typing various inputs:
Greetings like "hello", "hi", or "hey".
Time queries like "what is the time", "what time is it", or simply "time".
Farewells like "goodbye" or "bye".
Extend the Chatbot:


Add more patterns and responses to the chatbot. Think of additional questions users might ask and how the chatbot should respond. For example:
Ask for the chatbot's name: "what is your name".
Inquire about the weather: "what is the weather".
Ask how the chatbot is doing: "how are you".
